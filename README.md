## Description

It was developed respective to this[figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/BMomGVZqLZb811mDMShpLu/UI-design-Sportify-FR?node-id=0%3A1) and those [user stories](https://www.notion.so/Tableau-de-bord-SportSee-6686aa4b5f44417881a4884c9af5669e).

The project was developed with the [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) library.

## Prerequisites

The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment should have been installed on your system.
After you went through the installation, type the following instruction in the console :

```sh
node --version
```

A current version of node should be displayed.
The same is true for this instruction, displaying the current version of the Node Package Management (npm) :

```sh
npm --version
```

## Start the project

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/werner94fribourg/oc-projet-12.git
   ```

2. Clone the mock backend repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard
   ```
3. Install the npm dependencies on the backend and on the frontend project
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Execution

1. Execute the backend project on your local environment : it will start it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
2. Execute the frontend project on your local environment
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Since the port 3000 is already occupied by the backend application, a message asking you to deploy the app on another port will be displayed. Click the "y" button on your keyboard to allow the deployment.
4. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
